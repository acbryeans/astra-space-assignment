# Astra Luxury Travel - Agent Assignment Algorithm

## TLDR
**Want to see the final result?** Jump straight to **[Phase 3](Phase%203%20-%20Production%20Implementation%20-%20SQL%20Server%20Stored%20Procedure.md)** for the production SQL Server stored procedure.

## What This Is

A customer-to-agent assignment algorithm built for a space travel company. Takes customer details (communication method, lead source, destination) and returns agents ranked from best to worst match.

## The 3-Phase Approach

**[Phase 1: Exploration and Planning](Phase%201%20-%20Exploration%20and%20Planning.md)**  
Analyzed the data, figured out the scoring approach, decided on weighted algorithm over if-statement logic.

**[Phase 2: Algorithm Development](Phase%202%20-%20Algorithm%20Development%20and%20Implementation%20in%20SQLite.md)**  
Built the working algorithm in SQLite. Two-step CTE structure with performance aggregation and weighted scoring.

**[Phase 3: Production Implementation](Phase%203%20-%20Production%20Implementation%20-%20SQL%20Server%20Stored%20Procedure.md)**  
Converted to SQL Server stored procedure with proper error handling and input validation.
